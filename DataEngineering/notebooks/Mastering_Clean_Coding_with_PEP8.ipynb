It's important to note that using tab indents is generally more reliable than spaces. This is due to the uniform nature of tabs, which reduces the likelihood of errors compared to varying numbers of spaces in code blocks. In Python, a standard indent equates to four spaces, and it's easy to mistakenly use three or five spaces instead. Therefore, utilizing the Tab key (on Windows) for indents is advisable. Also, it's a good practice to keep a line of code within 80 characters; if it exceeds, it should be continued on the next line.\n",
